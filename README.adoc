== Status

*Travis C/I* Project Health -

== Purpose

This is an open-source tool to continuously translate any asciidoctor file that is changed within a defined folder.

== DropBox or Google Drive Enabled ?

This trick works nicely if you have a shared drive service like *Dropbox*, or *Google Drive* etc. and all your internal systems use the same *Dropbox*,etc. account.

On one of my least-used systems, did the following:

.Gradle Continuous Doctor Translation
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/Dropbox
git clone https://github.com/jnorthr/DoctorPepper.git
cd ~/Dropbox/DoctorPepper
gradlew -t asciidoctor
----

The *-t* option keeps gradle running in continuous mode so now any changes i make to any asciidoctor files are near-instantly
translated for me.

.This is a comment for the text that follows ?
The code we write today and tomorrow will probably never run on a single processor system: parallel hardware has become standard.  Not so with the software though, at least not yet.
